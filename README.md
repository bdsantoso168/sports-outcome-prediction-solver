# Sports Outcome Prediction Using Solver Optimization

This repository contains an **educational sports analytics project** that applies **Excel Solver–based optimization** to model and compare game outcomes across multiple professional sports leagues. The project demonstrates how least-squares optimization can be used to estimate **relative team strength** and **home advantage**, and how model behavior varies across sports with different scoring structures.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore how **optimization techniques** can be applied to real-world sports data to:

- Estimate team ratings based on historical game results  
- Quantify home-field / home-court advantage  
- Compare model behavior across different sports environments  

Two leagues are analyzed:
- **NFL** – Low-scoring, high-variance environment
- **NBA** – High-scoring, large-sample environment

Both models use the same underlying framework but produce different numerical characteristics due to sport-specific dynamics.

## Modeling Approach

For each league, the following steps were performed:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Game results were scraped from publicly available sports reference websites using Python.
2. **Data Preparation**
   - Data was cleaned and structured using Excel Power Query.
   - Game-level margins were computed.
3. **Solver Optimization**
   - Excel Solver was used to minimize the **sum of squared errors (SSE)** between actual and predicted margins.
   - Team ratings and a home advantage parameter were optimized.
   - A constraint was imposed such that the **average team rating equals zero**.
4. **Interpretation**
   - Model outputs were analyzed and compared across sports.
   - Neutral-site comparisons were used to illustrate how ratings translate into predicted margins.

## NFL Model (Super Bowl Application)

- Based on 2025 NFL regular season data
- Includes estimation of home-field advantage
- Super Bowl treated as a **neutral-site game**
- Final output includes a predicted point margin between the two Super Bowl teams

**Key takeaway:**  
NFL outcomes exhibit higher relative volatility due to fewer games and lower scoring, resulting in larger sensitivity to individual matchups.

## NBA Model (Cross-Sport Extension)

- Based on 2026 NBA regular season data
- Uses the same Solver framework as the NFL model
- Produces a tighter distribution of team ratings and a smaller home-court advantage

An example neutral-site comparison (Boston Celtics vs. Los Angeles Lakers) is included to demonstrate how NBA ratings can be interpreted.

**Key takeaway:**  
Higher scoring and larger sample sizes in the NBA lead to more stable optimization behavior compared to the NFL.
